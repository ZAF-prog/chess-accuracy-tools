1)
Review the uploaded PDFs, for the algorithms described.
Extract every mathematical variable defined, and create a dictionary mapping them to their definitions.
Make sure all formulas are transcribed, and the details of parameter estimation are provided.
Use Python syntax for the expressions, rather than Latex.
Write a concise but precise specification, sufficient for software implementation.
Include comments, and explanation for the data used.

2) Explain the step-by-step logic of a program needed for the algorithm specified above.
3) Write a Python implementation of the above, using pychess, NumPy, sci-kit.
Run Stockfish as the chess engine, making sure persistent mode is utilized to minimize
overhead due to re-initializations for the many calls necessary.
 Distribute as large hash memory as possible, taking 80% of system total available.
Optimize performance with multi-core CPU workers, taking 60% of total system computing power.
Enable restarting with pickle files.
 The program takes PGN file as input (filename from commandline), with narrow range of Elo values.
 Output is CSV file, with name from basename of the input.
 Columns in output:
 filename,MULTI_PV,Number_Games,Number_Moves,MinElo,MaxElo,AvgElo,s,c,AE_e,FirstYear,LastYear
