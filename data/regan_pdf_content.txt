Abstract
This paper keeps a running compendium of Intrinsic Performance Ratings (IPR’s) for se-
lected events and player performances in the recorded history of chess. The IPR methodology
is based on [RH11, RMH11] and updated here.
1 Introduction
The idea of Intrinsic Performance Ratings (IPR’s) is to judge skill based on the quality of decisions
made rather than the outcomes of contests. Aside from the issue that the outcome depends on the
skill of opponents and on factors variously called “luck,” there is a simple sample-size motivation.
A chess professional may play 50 games in a given year and call that a lot, but as a statistical
sample this is scant. However, those games may average 30 important move decisions, yielding a
healthy sample of 1,500 moves. Analysis of those moves by computer programs to sufﬁcient depth
to be stronger than the player can then provide both an objective measure of skill, and reasonably
informative conﬁdence intervals on the assessment.
A common feature of chess magazines or columns, one long called “Solitaire Chess” in maga-
zines of the US Chess Federation, involves pausing before each move (usually those by the winning
side) of a selected game, and choosing from several plausible alternatives. A strong player com-
posing the puzzle has provided point values for each choice. At the end the reader adds up the
points for all of his/her choices, and there is a table giving corresponding skill levels. The levels
are often given as ratings on the international Elo scale, where for instance 2200 is commonly the
threshold for “master,” or it may give prose names master, expert, amateur, etc. for those levels.
We do not know of any attempt to make this correspondence scientiﬁc.
The IPR model is basically “Solitaire Chess” done scientiﬁcally, using suitably-scaled dif-
ferences in values given to moves by authoritative chess programs as the “points.” Although the
differences are negative, the model would be unchanged if we declared that the best move is always
worth 5 points and differences in the usual pawn/centipawn units of chess engines were subtracted
1

from it. The correspondence between points and Elo rating is ﬁrst established by training the model
on large sets of games by players with established Elo ratings. The model generates projections of
how many points a player with a given Elo rating would score on a standardized “Solitaire Set.”
To generate an IPR for a player’s performance in an event, or for a whole event, or for any set
of games, we run the training process in reverse: First we train the model on that set of games.
Then we take the parameter values that were ﬁtted in the training, and use them to generate a
projected points value on the Solitaire Set. The corresponding Elo value is then read off. We do
not go directly from the parameters to Elo because there is more than one dependent parameter
in the model, and the tradeoff between the two parameters called s and c in the current simple
form already seems difﬁcult to assess. The “Solitaire” step also affords a reasonable way to project
conﬁdence intervals that currently seem to be no worse than about 30% too narrow—i.e., modeling
error requires no more than a 1.4 multiplier on them.
Full details are in the papers [RH11, RMH11], after earlier work [DHR09, HRD10] that built
on [Haw03, Haw07]. The main differences from work by Guid and Bratko [GB06, GPB08, GB11]
are the use of Multi-PV analysis to obtain authoritative values for all reasonable options, not just
the top move(s) and the move played, and the discovery that human players behave as though
relative values are scaled in proportion to the overall value of a position. The latter means that a
value difference of, say, 20 centipawns between movesm1 and m2 as judged by an engine yields a
greater incidence of human players selecting the better move m1 when the position is (say) within
20 centipawns of being equal, as when one side is (say) 100 centipawns ahead. Indeed a “marginal
centipawn” seems to have 5ximpact when the engine’s evaluation is +20 to one side as when it is
+100. This is like the idea that price movements in stocks or bonds should be plotted in proportion
to the current price, i.e. on log-log paper rather than standard axes.
To reprise some details from [RMH11, RMH11], the deﬁning equation of the particular model
used there and here is the following, which relates the probabilitypi of the i-th alternative move to
p0 for the best move and its difference in value:
log(1/pi)
log(1/p0) = e−(δ
s)
c
, where δi =
∫ v0
vi
1
1 +|z|dz. (1)
Here when the value v0 of the best move and vi of the i-th move have the same sign, the integral
giving the scaled difference simpliﬁes to|log(1+ v0)−log(1+ vi)|. This employs the empirically-
determined logarithmic scaling law.
The skill parameters are calledsfor “sensitivity” andcfor “consistency” becauseswhen small
can enlarge small differences in value, whilecwhen large sharply cuts down the probability of poor
moves. The equation solved directly for pi becomes
pi = pα
0 where α= e−(δ
s)
c
. (2)
The constraint ∑
ipi = 1thus determines all values. By ﬁtting these derived probabilities to actual
frequencies of move choice in training data, we can ﬁnd values of s and c corresponding to the
training set.
Once we have sand c, these equations give us projected probabilitiespi,t for every legal move
mi in the position at every relevant game turn t. Per arbitrary choice we omit: game turns 1–8,
turns involved in repetitions of the position, and turns where the program judges an advantage
2

greater than 300 centipawns for either side. These and some other modeling decisions are given
detail and justiﬁcation in [RH11].
To set up the correspondence to Elo rating, we deﬁne theexpected average errorstatistic AEe.
For comparison we also deﬁne the expected move-matchingstatistic MMe, which is the projected
number of agreement’s with the computer program’s ﬁrst choice of move. The following deﬁni-
tions tacitly assume that all move decisions are independent, which although violated by the idea
of multi-move “plans,” is arguably close enough when one has a large set of moves in various
games. Note that they also give projected standard deviations for these two quantities.

Table 1 gives the values of AEe that were obtained by ﬁrst ﬁtting the training data for 2006–09,
to obtain s,c, then computing the expectation for the union of the training sets. It was found
that a smaller set S of moves comprising the games of the 2005 and 2007 world championship
tournaments and the 2006 world championship match gave identical results to the fourth decimal
place, so Swas used as the ﬁxed “Solitaire Set.”

AEe .0572 .0624 .0689 .0749 .0843 .0883
Table 1: Correspondence between Elo rating from 2006–2009 and projected Average Error.
A simple linear ﬁt then yields the rule to produce the Elo rating for any (s,c), which we call
an “Intrinsic Performance Rating” (IPR) when the (s,c) are obtained by analyzing the games of a
particular event and player(s).
IPR = 3571−15413 ·AEe. (4)
This expresses, incidentally, that at least from the vantage of R YBKA 3 run to reported depth
13, perfect play has a rating under 3600. This is reasonable when one considers that if a 2800
player such as Vladimir Kramnik is able to draw one game in ﬁfty, the opponent can never have
a higher rating than that. The ﬁtted s,c values obtained in [RH11], including those forming a
“central artery” of values sfit,cfit in a single ﬁtted line, became the following table of Elo values
in [RMH11]:

Table 2: Elo correspondence in three four-year intervals.
Nlote that the ﬁtted Elo values don’t say exactly 2700, 2600, 2500, etc. This is the natural
result of doing a linear ﬁt. Some points in the 1600–2100 range are anomalous, and this may
owe to various factors pertaining to the quality of the games and gamescores. Only the Elo 2200
through 2700 data for 2006–2009 were used in the linear ﬁt for the ratings.
The procedure for generating an IPR for a given set T of positions and chosen moves is the
following—where Sis the ﬁxed “Solitaire Set” deﬁned above.
1. Do a regression on the test set T to ﬁt sT,cT.
2. Use sT,cT to project AEe on the reference set S(not on T).
3. Derive IPR from AEe via equation (4).
4. Use sT,cT on the test set T (not on S) only to project σT = σAEe.
5. Output [IPR −2σT,IPR + 2σT] as the proposed “95%” conﬁdence interval.
As noted toward the start of this section, early testing suggests replacing σT by σa = 1.4σT to get
an “actual” 95% conﬁdence interval given the model as it stands. Hence we show both ranges in
the tables. These ﬁts and conﬁdence intervals underlie teh following results.
2 IPRs of Tournaments
Since the IPR is based only on game analysis and has no functional component from Elo, it extends
before the adoption of Elo to the beginning of chess. Hence we include some tournaments before
1971, while noting the correspondence bewteen IPR and tournament category after that.

Table 7: Some other events, for comparison to Tables 5
and 6.
The IPR’s are on-balance below the tournament average ratings, but the latter’s aggregate is
just within the narrower conﬁdence interval of the aggregate IPR. The regressions are not linear,
so the parity of the aggregate run with the weighted average is notable. The comparison events are
selective but still show no inﬂationary trend.

3 IPR’s of Matches
Again we begin with some historical matches and their results. We distinguish the follow-
ing under a more-liberal deﬁnition of world championship besides the standard one: An-
dressen earned the title by unofﬁcial but fairly general understanding from London 1851, and
then lost it in 1858 to Paul Morphy, who vacated it back to Anderssen before 1866. See
http://www.worldchesslinks.net/ezc08.html for our inclusion of the 1866–1876
Steinitz matches, while we consider Karpov-Korchnoi 1974 to have been known as a likely cham-
pionship match at the time of its playing.

4 IPRs of Big Swiss Event(s)
We analyzed all 624 available games from 647 played at the 2011 Canadian Open, including all by
players with FIDE ratings 2400 and above, which form an unbiased sample. Table 14 shows the
IPR’s and compares them to Chess Federation of Canada ratings before and after the event, FIDE
ratings before, and the tournament performance ratings (TPR’s) based on the CFC ratings. The
ﬁnal two columns are the conﬁdence intervals for the IPR alone. The ﬁnal rows summarize the
sample, the whole event (152 players minus 3 early withdrawals leaving 149), and the whole event
weighted by number of games played and number of analyzed moves. The bottom-right restricts to
the 115 players who had FIDE ratings before the event. All players with 2400+ Canadian ratings
are named. While the IPR’s for tournaments with average ratings over 2700 are by-and-large low,
these are markedly high especially relative to thse players’ FIDE ratings. The time control was 40
moves in 90 minutes plus 30 second increment, then G/30 plus the same increment.

Table 14: Comparison of FIDE and CFC ratings, TPR’s, and
IPR’s for 2011 Canadian Open
1. The IPR’s have similar overall average to the Canadian ratings, especially under weighting
by games or moves.
2. FIDE ratings of Canadian players are deﬂated relative to apparent skill. This is commonly
believed to be due to a lack of playing opportunities in FIDE-rated events.
3. The IPR’s have higher deviations from their own mean than the TPR’s.
4. The IPR’s have large deviation, and yet several TPR’s fall outside even the 2.8-sigma range.
This may constrain the usefulness of the IPR as an estimator of the TPR.
