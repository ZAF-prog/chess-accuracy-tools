In
 
the
 
methodology
 
developed
 
by
 
Kenneth
 
Regan,
 
the
 
"Solitaire
 
Set"
 
(S)
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
standardized
 
"benchmark
 
test"
 
designed
 
to
 
remove
 
the
 
variable
 
of
 
game
 
difficulty
 
when
 
calculating
 
a
 
player's
 
rating.
 
1.
 
What
 
is
 
the
 
Solitaire
 
Set
 
(S)?
 
The
 
Solitaire
 
Set
 
(S)
 
is
 
a
 
fixed
 
collection
 
of
 
chess
 
positions
 
taken
 
from
 
the
 
2005
 
and
 
2007
 
World
 
Championship
 
tournaments
 
and
 
the
 
2006
 
World
 
Championship
 
match
11
.
 
Although
 
these
 
specific
 
games
 
were
 
originally
 
played
 
by
 
elite
 
players
 
with
 
a
 
narrow
 
rating
 
range
 
(approximately
 
2670–2801),
 
in
 
the
 
model,
 
they
 
function
 
only
 
as
 
a
 
static
 
set
 
of
 
"test
 
questions"

How
 
Parameters
 
are
 
Translated
 
into
 
Elo
 
The
 
concern
 
regarding
 
the
 
"narrow
 
range"
 
is
 
resolved
 
by
 
distinguishing
 
between
 
the
 
calibration
 
data
 
and
 
the
 
standardized
 
benchmark
:
 
●
 
Broad
 
Calibration:
 
The
 
model's
 
understanding
 
of
 
"what
 
an
 
1800
 
player
 
looks
 
like"
 
vs.
 
"what
 
a
 
2700
 
player
 
looks
 
like"
 
comes
 
from
 
a
 
massive
 
Training
 
Set
 
(e.g.,
 
games
 
from
 
2006–2009)
 
that
 
includes
 
players
 
across
 
the
 
entire
 
Elo
 
spectrum,
 
from
 
1600
 
to
 
2700+
333333333
.
 
 
●
 
The
 
Translation
 
Bridge:
 
To
 
create
 
a
 
universal
 
scale,
 
the
 
authors
 
take
 
the
 
skill
 
parameters
 
($s,
 
c$)
 
belonging
 
to
 
each
 
rating
 
group
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
data
 
and
 
calculate
 
what
 
their
 
Expected
 
Average
 
Error
 
($AE_e$)
 
would
 
be
 
if
 
they
 
were
 
to
 
play
 
through
 
the
 
positions
 
in
 
the
 
Solitaire
 
Set
 
(S)
444444
.
 
 
●
 
The
 
Linear
 
Fit:
 
This
 
process
 
generates
 
a
 
table
 
of
 
$AE_e$
 
values
 
corresponding
 
to
 
specific
 
Elo
 
levels
 
(Table
 
1)5.
 
From
 
this,
 
a
 
simple
 
linear
 
equation
 
is
 
derived
 
to
 
produce
 
the
 
final
 
Intrinsic
 
Performance
 
Rating
 
(IPR)6:
 
 
$$IPR
 
=
 
3571
 
-
 
15413
 
\cdot
 
AE_e$$

What
 
does
 
"Projected"
 
Mean?
 
In
 
this
 
paper,
 
"projected"
 
refers
 
to
 
a
 
mathematical
 
expectation
 
rather
 
than
 
an
 
actual
 
historical
 
occurrence.
 
●
 
Mathematical
 
Probability:
 
Once
 
skill
 
parameters
 
($s,
 
c$)
 
are
 
fitted
 
to
 
a
 
player's
 
performance
 
in
 
a
 
test
 
set
 
(T),
 
those
 
parameters
 
provide
 
a
 
probability
 
($p_i$)
 
for
 
every
 
possible
 
legal
 
move
 
in
 
any
 
given
 
position
8
.
 
 
●
 
Standardization:
 
"Projecting"
 
onto
 
Set
 
S
 
means
 
the
 
model
 
takes
 
the
 
player's
 
measured
 
skill
 
and
 
calculates
 
their
 
Expected
 
Average
 
Error
 
on
 
the
 
specific
 
positions
 
in
 
the
 
benchmark
 
Set
 
S,
 
rather
 
than
 
the
 
games
 
they
 
actually
 
played
999
.
 
 
●
 
Eliminating
 
Difficulty
 
Bias:
 
This
 
is
 
crucial
 
because
 
some
 
games
 
are
 
"easier"
 
to
 
play
 
accurately
 
than
 
others.
 
By
 
projecting
 
every
 
player
 
onto
 
the
 
same
 
set
 
of
 
positions
 
(Set
 
S),
 
the
 
model
 
ensures
 
that
 
an
 
IPR
 
of
 
2400
 
represents
 
the
 
same
 
level
 
of
 
precision
 
regardless
 
of
 
whether
 
the
 
original
 
games
 
were
 
tactical
 
shootouts
 
or
 
quiet
 
endgames

"Playing
 
Through"
 
the
 
Positions
 
"Playing
 
through"
 
the
 
positions
 
in
 
Set
 
S
 
does
 
not
 
mean
 
the
 
player
 
actually
 
sat
 
down
 
to
 
play
 
them.
 
Instead,
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
statistical
 
simulation
 
where
 
the
 
model
 
uses
 
the
 
player’s
 
previously
 
determined
 
$s$
 
and
 
$c$
 
values
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
mathematical
 
probability
 
of
 
the
 
player
 
making
 
various
 
errors
 
across
 
all
 
moves
 
in
 
the
 
Solitaire
 
Set
11111111
.
 
The
 
sum
 
of
 
these
 
probabilities
 
yields
 
the
 
Expected
 
Average
 
Error
 
($AE_e$)
,
 
which
 
is
 
then
 
converted
 
into
 
the
 
final
 
IPR
12121212
.
